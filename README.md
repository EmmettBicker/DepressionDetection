# Good Health and Well Being: Screening for Depression on Twitter
# Using a Sentiment Analysis Neural Network

 Emmett Bicker


**Motivation**

Many of my friends displayed symptoms of depression after the COVID-19 pandemic began and schools switched to remote learning. I am unaware if any of them received help, but I noticed my friends were also displaying depressive symptoms on social media platforms such as Discord, Reddit, and Twitter. Only ⅓ of those with depression ever seek out help while ⅔ of the depressed population suffer undiagnosed.[^1] Studies have shown remote learning to increase students’ anxiety and depression.[^2] Depression, most prevalent in adolescents, has become more widespread due to COVID-19. A late 2020 national survey reported that 17.0% of all U.S. children aged 12-17 have had a major depressive episode, 12.0% have seriously considered suicide, and 2.5% attempted suicide in the past year. If depression is detected early, complications such as substance abuse, self-harm, and suicide can be prevented.[^3]

**Overview**

The change I noticed in my friends' social media behavior and the rise in depression inspired me to make a depression detector for social media. The project I made was a sentiment analysis depression screener, in which my program would analyze a tweet and output if the tweet showed signs of depression. My program, *Are You Sad?*, then does this for up to the last 2500 tweets a user has posted and graphs the change in their mental health over the past few years. The product will be free as I want everyone to have the ability to screen their loved ones for mental health issues. While I made the project with high schoolers affected by COVID-19 in mind, the final product can be used to graph anyone's emotional state over time. Twitter is a good social media to screen for depression because 85% of Twitter users are under the age of 50,[^4] and 83% of people who suffer from depression are under 50.[^5] It can also be used by community volunteers and non medically trained staff to detect depression in areas that are often overlooked in developing countries, such as postpartum depression, which can be treated if correctly identified early on.[^6]
